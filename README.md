# About `wpm`

`wpm` is a small utility to install software application for Windows.

# Planning

This repo is NOT ready to serve but I have the follow plan.

Problem to solve:

- Install software in background, no click-clicks.
- In different Windows systems (including XP-SP3?)
- From local source, e.g. USB
- With preset options able to render in installation, e.g. application language

This repo is not going to compete with Windows Store, Chocolatey, scoop.sh, Ninite, etc. It will focus on localization, portability, and not-occupy-network-bandwidth.
